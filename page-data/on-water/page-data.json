The 8th Ayurveda Day in India is just around the corner, and we're excited to share some information with you. We want to clarify a few things about drinking water and its role in our daily lives.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, drinking water is a wonderful and essential part of our well-being, much like a delicious scoop of ice cream. It doesn't matter if you have water before, during, or after your meals, or whether you prefer sips or gulps – it's all about staying hydrated and enjoying your water the way you like it.</p>\n<p>While some believe in the power of warm or cold water for various health concerns, we'd like to remind you that water, in itself, isn't a magical remedy. It's essential for life, helps transport nutrients, regulates body temperature, and plays a crucial role in bodily functions.</p>\n<p>Now, when it comes to health issues like cold, cough, or fever, remember that these symptoms can have various causes. If you're feeling unwell, it's always a good idea to consult a doctor rather than relying solely on warm water sips. They can provide the expert guidance you need.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we'd like to emphasize that the term 'indigestion' is quite broad and simplifying a complex process. It's important to respect the intricate workings of our body's metabolic processes.</p>\n<p>So, let's enjoy our water and stay healthy, just like we enjoy a delightful ice cream treat. Water is indeed vital, but it's not a cure-all, and it's always best to consult a healthcare professional when in doubt about your health. Stay well and hydrated, friends!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/theliverdr/status/1721339149318537271\">Read Original Tweet</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On Water","date":"November 06, 2023","description":"We want to clarify a few things about drinking water and its role in our daily lives."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/on-jaggery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On Jaggery"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"08fe43ae-ec1a-5c07-8281-443dd465f3a3","previousPostId":"2e4c768b-3551-5984-aa72-2b9efc8c741b","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
